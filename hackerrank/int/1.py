# Mud and Wall
# One unit width of gap between walls will contain one segment of packed raw material
# The height of the raw material cannot exceed 1 unit more than adjacent wall
# E.g. 
# wallPos = [1, 5, 7]
# wallHeight = [4, 6, 8]
# Input
# 3 (this is n)
# 1 6 9 (wallPos)
# 4 3 3 (wallHeight)
# Output
# 6 (maximum wall of segment)
